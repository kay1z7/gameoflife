Random ornament

Game of Life,  is a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway in 1970. In my version of Game of Life, I tried to make something that stimulates ornament drawings.

Rules
- If number of neiboors is equel to 2, it gets painted maroon colour
- The drawing on the ornamet will start from the middle, and also from two random dots at the same time, so the picture won't be the same every time you run it.
